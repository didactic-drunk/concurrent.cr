# Allows **one** fiber to wait until a series of operations performed in other fibers complete.
#
# This class has additional capabilities not found in java or other implementations:
# - `wait_count` may be set at initialization or if not provided to initialize() any time after (only once between resets).
# - Reset is allowed after the latch is released.  The object may be reused but is not a cyclic barrier.
#
# A single atomic counter is used.
# This implementation is 30-40% faster than using a Mutex or Channel::Buffered on Crystal 0.29.0-dev and likely to be faster still when
# channels are thread safe.
